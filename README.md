In this project we used MySQL to explore data involving the global impact COVID 19 had on job layoffs by company.

Skills used:
  Strategized different ways to answer the question of how the Pandemic impacted company layoffs:
  Used a combination of CTE and subquery to build running total of laid off employees as a whole by month
  Used multiple CTEs to build a top 5 list of company layoffs by year
  Manipulated data using Max() to show which companies laid off their entire staff
  Created a date range using Min() and Max()
  Manipulated data to show which industries were hardest impacted by the pandemic by year, by country, and by industry.
